From here I'll show you how to access some special features of this mod.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First we have HUD Overhaul options.
-Cinematic
-Dust&Dirt
-Directors Cut (a combination of the first two with a few extra tweaks)
-2014 PreRelease Build (an earlier version of the HUD from before it's release)


Brief description of each file
   1.Cinematic: Adds small black bars to the top and bottom of the screen to give 
   the illusion of a wider aspect ratio. 


   2.Dust&Dirt: Adds varying levels of speckle to screen. 
   (if you choose this option 3 more files will become available to you each with it's own level of screen filth.)


   3.Director's Cut: My personal preference, adds both of the features listed above along with Tint enabled also 
   removes the crosshair (if one is enabled) while in incapacitated state.
*Tint adds a very subtle softness and color to the image. However it is incompatible with ultra-wide monitors and therefore was left out of final build.



Please use only one of these.
To use these please copy all of the contents of the "SchismHUD" folder into a new folder then
grab the file option you want and copy/paste the files into the new SchismHUD folder and replace all files. 
Now repack the mod and place into your addons folder.

Alternate Downed State Fliter: Bubbly!

Do you find the red bloodied edges when incapacitated a bit too harsh and upsetting?
Then this one is for you! This optional filter give's the downed state a more friendly feel.
